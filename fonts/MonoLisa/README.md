# MonoLisa - Font follows function

Congratulations for purchasing MonoLisa. I hope you have as much fun using it as we had creating the typeface.

## Installation

The font is distributed as a pair of ttf files with variable weights. The exact range that's provided depends on the version you bought.

The fastest way to install the font is to copy the two files to the font directory of your operating system. After that you should be able to see the available weights in the font browser of your system.

[Please see the FAQ online](https://www.monolisa.dev/faq#how-to-install-the-typeface) for more specific instructions and information.

## Customization

Depending on the version you bought, you may have access to the customize tool available online. You can [find it at your orders page](https://www.monolisa.dev/orders).

The customize tool lets you alter the typeface to your liking. It also gives access to other formats, not just ttf, should you need them.

## How to enable the script variant or other features?

Please see [the FAQ online](https://www.monolisa.dev/faq#how-to-enable-alternate-zero-stylistic-sets-and-the-script-variant) for specific instructions.
